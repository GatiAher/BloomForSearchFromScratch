You don't seriously think they could let your ferret fly, right? Cueball: I... of course not. [They continue to talk.] Cueball: That would be pretty dumb. It's just, uh... ...a Halloween costume. Friend: oh, okay. [They continue to talk. But now the head of the ferret can be seen to the far right on a table.] Friend: Besides, who would want a pet to fly anyway? Cueball: Yeah. Pretty lame, huh? [The friend leaves the frame while Cueball stays. The ferret cannot be seen,] Friend: Anyway, let's go play video games. [Cueball stands behind after his friend has left.

Hatted: yeah, and it sure would be nice to have some historical perspective on some of this stuff. I just don't know what to make of it. [Circles are appearing--maybe snow?] Cueball: i guess you do what you can to help the people around you and hope it turns out okay. Cueball: in the end, what else can you do? Hatted: lead a crusade? [We can no longer see the people, just the circles.] it's presentism, man. the idea that historical context is irrelevant, that we understand it all that we need take no warnings from the follies of the past. that we're facing something new. socrates couldn't imagine the internet. but people don't change.

It has a few marks inside it.] [Closer, the square is divided into rectangles of different sizes, each of which has text in it.] [Much closer, we can see fragments of the text.

Faint panel borders appear again. There is a person on the far right.] (Back to three panels per row.) [Cueball and Megan are standing amid the fragments.] Cueball: There's too much. And so little feels important. [The jagged edge of the shaded area is encroaching on the sides of the panel.] What do you do? [We see them from farther away through a rough hole in the shaded area.

It's no secret that the hat guy is closely based on Aram, from Men in Hats. [Black Hat and Cueball are talking together in the same position in all four panels.] Cueball: Learning about the Holocaust has really shaken my belief in God. Black Hat: You know, as a young man, Hitler was rejected from art school. Cueball: Yeah... shame he didn't get in. Black Hat: Well, have you seen any of his paintings? They're awful. Defy all rules of composition. Cueball: What are you suggesting? Black Hat: Maybe there is a god, but he's a real art lover. Cueball: This is why I don't go out in public with you.

The drawing is repeated three time in the same panel, once for each comment by the two guys.] Pole-guy: The sky is so blue, and all the leaves are green. Friend: Haven't you ever wondered if we really see the same colors as everyone else? It's all perception. Pole-guy: Well, you might as well call into question all of human experience. Who really knows what world someone else sees? Friend: Yeah, I guess. Pole-guy: Anyway, can you help me down from this pole? Friend: What pole?
